# Pharmaceutical-ML
group 8 final project

In pharmacy, the relationship of  active chemical ingredients is very important. When this relationship is stressed by factors like temperature and time it is even more important to ensure that what goes into our body to save life is pure enough to be effective.

Lumab.csv was used to check the purity of the medication.
- Deamidation is a type of test for impurity.
- Entry in the csv refers to impurity measurement.
- Timepoint refers to time in month.
- Condition is the two categories of temperature, 5c and 25-60c.
- Sample-number is a unique entry for each sample.
- Lot refers to batch of samples.

We cleaned the data, created a scatter plot to check for trends on jupyter notebook lumab_colors and also checked for correlation of variables in our data set. Created linear regression using 5C temperature of about 220 dataset in lumabin jupyter notebook. Used Knn to check for accuracy in predicting impurity(ENRTY) on two temperature category 5 centigrade and 25-60 centigrade of 310 dataset found in lumab_knn_entry jupyter notebook.
